> ## Motivation
> In the last ten years, the barrier to entry for computer science has been dramatically reduced. What previously could only be studied in a lab has become something anyone can do. Why can't the same be true with controls? The aim of this project is to leverage available low cost hardware to provide learners with the ability to design real control systems and gain a stronger controls intuition.
